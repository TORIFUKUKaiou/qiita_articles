_**How many Qiitan mascots can you count!?**_


# Introduction

This article explains how to run the [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/), an Elixir-based development notebook, on [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.co.jp/features/codespaces).

To help you get started right away, I have published a repository on GitHub. Along with instructions on how to launch Livebook, I will also briefly discuss its contents.

This setup could potentially be used as an environment for programming beginners (although you will need to create a GitHub account).

However, this article does not cover how to use Livebook itself. After all, "practice makes perfect." For detailed guidance, I recommend checking out an excellent article on the subject written by @RyoWakabayashi. 

Of course, I‚Äôll also talk about Antonio Inoki and the "Fighting Spirit" philosophy. In a way, writing about **Fighting Spirit** is my main reason for writing this article. And yes, I‚Äôd love to see more Qiitan. :qiitan::qiitan::qiitan:

## Overview

Here is a visual summary of this article. (Powered by https://app.napkin.ai/)


![image.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/131808/86f47d60-ffba-fac2-198a-c3e93a3b4584.png)



## What is GitHub Codespaces?

Simply put, GitHub Codespaces allows you to develop using just a browser. The development machine (resources) exists in the cloud.

It embodies the spirit of "learn by doing," "leap before you look," and "build the airplane as you‚Äôre falling off the cliff." Or as Antonio Inoki would say:  
_"Don‚Äôt fear. Fear and the path disappears. Take one step forward, and that step becomes the path. Go without hesitation; you‚Äôll understand once you go."_  
The best way to understand it is by trying it out.

Here‚Äôs the official page for more information:  
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.co.jp/features/codespaces)

While it‚Äôs a paid service, if you use the lowest-spec machine, as of December 15, 2024, you can enjoy up to 80 hours per month for free. This makes it a practical tool for everyday use.  

More details can be found here:  
[GitHub Codespaces Billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)

Although knowledge of [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) can be helpful, it‚Äôs not strictly necessary for basic use, so I‚Äôll skip the details here. If you‚Äôre interested, follow the link for more information.  

In essence, GitHub Codespaces provides a seamless development experience with Docker containers integrated into Visual Studio Code and GitHub Codespaces. It feels as if you‚Äôre working on a Linux machine, without needing to consider the underlying Docker container. Development starts immediately within the container, and there‚Äôs rarely a moment where you need to think about Docker itself.

## Livebook

Livebook, in simple terms, is a notebook environment for Elixir.  
You can run it by installing Elixir on your local machine or by using Docker.

![image.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/131808/fc16ea8a-42c1-c846-9f42-49efc1cfd0f4.png)

Since it works with Docker, it should also work seamlessly with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.co.jp/features/codespaces).  
That‚Äôs what motivated me to try it out and share the results here.

Let‚Äôs dive into the details.

---

# Usage

I‚Äôve published [livebook-devcontainer](https://github.com/TORIFUKUKaiou/livebook-devcontainer) on GitHub.  
Here, I‚Äôll explain how to use it.

There are two options:

1. **Password Fixed Version:** Start Livebook with the password set to `securesecret`.  
2. **Password Auto-Generated Version:** Start Livebook with an automatically generated password.

Why are there two versions? I‚Äôll explain this later in the repository section.

Additionally, if you‚Äôre hesitant to use my setup directly without verification, that‚Äôs completely understandable. It‚Äôs always wise to exercise caution to avoid malware or other risks.

Later in this article, I‚Äôll explain the repository‚Äôs structure so that you can review the code and decide whether to use it as-is, fork it, or modify it to your needs. If you have ideas to improve it, feel free to submit a pull request or make your fork the new "main" version.


## 1. **Password Fixed Version:** Start Livebook with the password set to `securesecret`

Since this method uses the official Livebook image, startup is fast.  
Even on the minimum spec machine (2-core Machine type), you‚Äôll have a working Livebook environment in under two minutes.

Here‚Äôs how to start Livebook with the password set to `securesecret`:

1. Open [livebook-devcontainer](https://github.com/TORIFUKUKaiou/livebook-devcontainer) in your browser.  
2. Click **`<> Code (green button)` > `Codespaces` > ‚ãÆ > `+ New with options`.**

    ![Screenshot](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/131808/246b3e02-99b2-db8e-c1fa-f4b83e667f22.png)

3. Set the **Branch** to `main`, adjust other options to your preference, and confidently press the **Create codespace** button.

    ![Screenshot](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/131808/88bddf86-ed08-7f77-0145-96f229974e40.png)

4. Wait about **1 minute and 23 seconds**, and the environment will launch. Open the **Ports** tab at the bottom of the screen, hover over the **Forwarded Address** field for port `8080`, and click the faint globe icon that appears. 

    ![Screenshot](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/131808/f92b0e13-49e6-c313-5db0-8fa53c08562d.png)

5. Notice the **Private** display? This indicates the environment is accessible only when logged in with the GitHub account used to create the Codespace.

6. üéâ **Livebook is now running!** Enter `securesecret` as the password and enjoy developing with Livebook! That‚Äôs it‚Äîhave fun exploring!

    ![Screenshot](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/131808/06dc1e19-3c23-5376-ff2e-cc73cefd9137.png)

### Issues

Some notebooks, especially those that rely on JavaScript functionality, may not work as expected. For example, as of December 15, 2024, certain parts of the learning content included in Livebook 0.14.5, such as "Exploring built-in Kinos" (Learn > 01 Exploring built-in Kinos), do not function properly.

To address this, you can change the **Port Visibility** setting in step 5 of the previous instructions to "Public." Here's how:

- **Right-click** on the port entry in the **Ports tab** and change the visibility setting to **Public**.

While this adjustment enables the notebook to work, setting the port to **Public** literally makes it accessible to anyone. Since the password is `securesecret` (and relatively weak), there's a risk of someone else accessing your Livebook instance without permission, potentially leading to **regret**.

_If you're knowledgeable about Livebook, you might think, "Why not use an auto-generated password instead?" I had the same thought. However, when a Codespace starts, it‚Äôs already running inside a Docker container, and there‚Äôs no access to the host machine‚Äôs output where the auto-generated token is logged. I searched through devcontainer logs and other potential leads but couldn‚Äôt find a solution._

_Another idea I explored was connecting to the Livebook node directly[^1] and calling `LivebookWeb.Endpoint.access_url()`. Despite my efforts, I couldn't make it work. If you‚Äôve solved this issue, please share your insights in the comments or via a pull request. I‚Äôd be incredibly grateful! üôè_

[^1]: For those interested, this is the approach I tried: https://hexdocs.pm/iex/1.17.3/IEx.html#module-remote-shells

There may also be other cases where Livebook features don‚Äôt work as expected. To avoid exposing your instance unnecessarily and risking unauthorized access, it‚Äôs better to explore **Method 2: Auto-Generated Passwords**, discussed in the next section.

## 2. [Auto-Generated Password Method] Launching Livebook with an Auto-Generated Password

This method involves building Livebook yourself and manually starting it. By doing so, you can view the generated token directly from the startup logs.

The steps are almost identical to those in the previous method. In **Step 3**, switch the branch to `run-Livebook-directly-from-source`. From there, the process begins with installing Elixir and takes about 4 minutes and 9 seconds[^2]. While you wait, feel free to watch Antonio Inoki's retirement match[^3].

[^2]: Antonio Inoki's retirement match ended at exactly 4 minutes and 9 seconds, where he used the Grand Cobra Hold to defeat Don Frye, marking a glorious end to his career: https://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~yf7m-on/match5.html

[^3]: https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x95qrz6

Before proceeding to Step 4, you will need to start Livebook manually.

![Screenshot 2024-12-15 10.58.08.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/131808/a4b4f98d-5b21-de48-bad3-fe3d2b33e76e.png)

Below are the differences in steps compared to the previous method:

~~1. **Edit `/home/vscode/livebook/config/prod.exs`**~~
~~For those familiar with system configurations, this step involves changing the IP setting to allow the Phoenix application (in this case, Livebook) to connect via a load balancer or other front-facing component. Modify the IP setting in `/home/vscode/livebook/config/prod.exs` from `{127, 0, 0, 1}` to `{0, 0, 0, 0}`.~~  
~~*(Note: I attempted to restrict this further by resolving the load balancer's hostname to an IP address via `nslookup`, but Phoenix failed to start.)*~~

[Updated: 2024-12-16] Automatically Rewriting within the Dockerfile

2. **Start Livebook in the Terminal**  
   Once the setup is complete, Livebook will automatically start in the Terminal tab by running mix phx.server. Be sure to take note of the token value (**as it changes with each startup, there‚Äôs no issue sharing it publicly**).

   ![Screenshot 2024-12-15 11.29.50.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/131808/4e81de40-6070-3cba-c214-b5a9a5feb1d1.png)

3. **Proceed to Step 4 as before**  
   When prompted for the password, use the token from the startup logs.

If you need to run JavaScript-dependent notebooks, as in the previous method, change the **Port Visibility** setting to `Public`. While this method is more secure than using a fixed `securesecret` password, it is still not foolproof. Use with caution and at your own risk.

# Repository Overview

Here, I will provide an explanation of the [livebook-devcontainer](https://github.com/TORIFUKUKaiou/livebook-devcontainer) repository.

This repository provides configurations to deploy and use Livebook efficiently within GitHub Codespaces. Below, I will detail the two key branches and their purposes.



## Main Branch

This branch is used for launching Livebook with the fixed password `securesecret`.

The Docker command introduced in the [Livebook repository](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook) has been adapted into a `devcontainer` for seamless integration with GitHub Codespaces. 

Key details of this branch:

- **Official Docker Image**  
   The Docker image utilized here is the same as the one recommended by the official Livebook project, ensuring compatibility and reliability.

- **Pre-set Environment Variable**  
   The environment variable `LIVEBOOK_PASSWORD` is configured with the value `securesecret` to simplify access.

This branch is perfect for quick and straightforward setups!

## run-Livebook-directly-from-source Branch

This branch is tailored for a more hands-on approach, allowing you to build and run Livebook directly from its source. Key features include:

- **Base on Microsoft's Development Container Images**  
   Built on [Microsoft's Base Development Container Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/devcontainers-base) (Ubuntu 24.04), this setup provides an experience akin to developing on a Linux machine.

- **Pre-installed Elixir and Erlang**  
   Elixir and Erlang are installed using the [official installation script](https://new.phoenixframework.org/myapp) maintained by the Elixir team. (As highlighted in the article, ["A Deep Dive into the Redesigned Phoenix Official Page"](https://qiita.com/torifukukaiou/items/6c9025039ce2843209dd).)

- **Prepped for Livebook Development**  
   The repository already includes the following steps completed for Livebook:
   - Cloning the repository (`git clone`)
   - Fetching dependencies (`mix deps.get`)
   - Compiling the code (`mix compile`)

- **Configuring IP for Load Balancer Access**
    To enable access to the Phoenix application (in this case, Livebook) from a load balancer-like front-end connected to the internet, the IP configuration is modified. This is done by editing `/home/vscode/livebook/config/prod.exs` using `sed`.

- **Launch for Token Generation**  
   By running `mix phx.server`, the output is displayed in the terminal, allowing you to confirm the automatically generated token yourself.

This branch offers greater control and flexibility, making it ideal for users who want to explore the Livebook source in depth.

# We Need Better Solutions!

The `run-Livebook-directly-from-source` method has its flaws‚ÄîI know this well. I want to avoid the regret of setting the [Port Visibility] to `Public`. Some aspects of the methods introduced in this article may be incorrect. If you know a better or more accurate solution, please share it in the comments section!

---

## Problems Identified

Below are the issues I believe exist or areas where better solutions may be possible. With over 20 years of experience, I don‚Äôt think my approach is entirely wrong, but there‚Äôs always room for improvement:

- How can we reliably retrieve the auto-generated `token` when launching a container from the official Livebook image on Codespaces?
- Is there a way to use JS-based features without setting the [Port Visibility] to `Public`?
- In `/home/vscode/livebook/config/prod.exs`, is there a way to restrict the `:ip` configuration to something other than `{0, 0, 0, 0}`?
- Are there other Livebook features that might not function properly under the current setup?

---

If you notice anything or have suggestions for improvements, please leave your insights in the comments section. Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

# Goals

Here‚Äôs what I want to achieve.

Currently, the Livebook, Elixir, and Erlang versions are set to the latest as of 2024-12-15. I plan to keep these updated in the future. However, I worry that I might forget to update them, so I want to solve this issue through automation.

---

## Automation Plan

I aim to implement the following:

- **Automating Updates**
    - I believe this can be achieved using **GitHub Actions**.
        - I already know about periodic execution in GitHub Actions and have experience with Git Push workflows.
        - However, I lack detailed knowledge of text manipulation commands like `sed`.
        - I could consult ChatGPT Plus for help or write a custom script to handle the updates efficiently.

---

By automating these updates, I hope to ensure the project remains up-to-date without relying on manual intervention.

# Unused Codespaces: Save Costs by Deleting Them

When you're done using a Codespace, you can delete it to save costs. If needed, you can always create a new one later.

To manage and delete unused Codespaces, visit:

[https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)

Deleting unused Codespaces can help you manage your budget effectively. One of the benefits of using the cloud is the ease of creating, breaking, and recreating environments as needed.

# Notes for Using in Beginner-Friendly Hands-On Sessions

In the introduction, I mentioned the potential use of this setup for beginner programming environments. I believe it can be used effectively for this purpose.

However, since my use case does not involve hands-on sessions, I recommend thorough rehearsal before utilizing it in such a setting. Here are some points to focus on during rehearsal:

- **Test the hands-on content:** Ensure everything can be executed smoothly while keeping the port visibility range set to "Private." This minimizes the risk of unintended **regrets**.
- **Set an appropriate timeout period:** Refer to [GitHub Codespaces timeout period settings](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/setting-your-timeout-period-for-github-codespaces) and configure the timeout value as needed for the session.

For "true beginners" who do not yet have a GitHub account, it's worth noting that this process still poses a significant hurdle.
